          <h3>About Ian</h3>
            <p>
              Most of my adult life has been spent in the financial industry. I love helping people find solutions but the financial realm did not satisfy my creative side.
            </p>                                    
            <p>
              Now that I am a student with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> I am now able to combine my love of finding solutions with a creative twist!
            </p>
            <p>So if you are looking for someone who is passionate about providing creative solutions then please reach out! I am always excited to work with other developers to creat collaborative masterpieces. </p>
